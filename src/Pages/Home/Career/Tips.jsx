                    <p>The internet's a jungle of resume advice, and finding the guidance that’s right for you can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. But as experts in hourly work, we're here to make your journey to the perfect job a whole lot smoother. We’ve got advice that’s custom-built for workers like you.</p>

                    <h1 className="text-3xl mt-12 mb-6">The essential components of a resume</h1>
                    <h3 className="my-3 font-bold text-lg">Name and contact information</h3>
                    <p>First up, place your name and how to reach you, big and bold up top for all to see. Proofread to make sure your phone number and email address are correct, so potential employers can connect with ease. Sounds basic, right? But trust us, clarity matters and mistakes happen, so don’t let them happen to you. </p>

                    <h3 className="my-3 font-bold text-lg">Skills</h3>
                    <p>Highlighting your abilities is key. These can be specific technical skills like using a Point-of-sale system, having a food-handling certification, or driving a forklift. But you can also include soft skills like “customer service” or “excellent communicator.” We recommend putting this section up top after your contact information.</p>

                    <h3 className="my-3 font-bold text-lg">Work history</h3>
                    <p>Next, the star of the show – your work history. We'll guide you on how to showcase the experiences that truly matter, helping you shine in the eyes of hiring managers. If you’re applying for your very first job, it’s fine to put volunteer work, babysitting, and lawn-mowing on there. But if you do that, keep it really short and simple – no need to pad it out. Employers who are allowed to hire teens will understand this, so don’t stress about it.</p>

                    <h3 className="my-3 font-bold text-lg">Education</h3>
                    <p>Your highest level obtained, the name of the school you attended, and the city and state of that school. Some job applicants choose to put this near the top of a resume, while others prefer the bottom. We say you can put it before your work history if you’re fresh out of school (or still in school!), but for everyone else keep it after. </p>

                    <h1 className="text-3xl mt-12 mb-6">What not to include</h1>
                    <div className="space-y-3">
                    <p className="mb-3">There are some things that aren’t required in a resume and can sometimes even hurt your chances of getting an interview. Overall, we recommend keeping it simple.</p>
                    <p>Full address: Your city and state are enough. No need for the full address in the resume itself, since those will be in your job application. Having it in two places not only creates more work for you, for some employers it can create a privacy issue during the hiring process.</p>
                        
                        <p>Photo or headshot: Skip the pictures. Your skills matter more than your selfie. While having a photo on your resume is a thing in some countries, U.S. employers don’t expect it. So when they see one it can make them question your judgment – or even give them a reason to discriminate against you unfairly. So even if you’ve got a great photo, don’t do it!</p>
                        
                        <p>Resume objective: This is kind of an old-fashioned idea anyway. And for hourly jobs, it's really not needed or expected. Employers know why you’re applying for a job: you want to work. They might probe more during an interview as part of a get-to-know you thing, but it’s not something you need to provide in writing as part of your application.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                        References: You may be asked for references after you have applied for a job, and sometimes some employers request them as part of your application, but you should not automatically include them on every application. Why not? Ideally, you’ll want to give your references a heads-up about who exactly might be calling them and when. It not only helps your references help you, it’s just polite!
